    <p>Effective Date: 20/November/2024</p>
      <p>Pointy Notes - Bullet Points ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy and is committed to being transparent about how we handle your data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect user data when you use our mobile application, [App Name].</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal or non-personal information from users. All user data, such as notes or other app-generated content, is saved locally on the user's device and is not transmitted to any server or cloud storage.</p>
    <p>However, we use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to monitor app performance and crashes. These services collect anonymous usage data to help us improve the app's performance and resolve issues. No personal or sensitive user data is included in this collection.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Collected Data</h2>
    <p>We do not access or use any user-generated data (e.g., notes) since it is stored entirely on the user's device. Data collected by Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify and fix app crashes.</li>
        <li>Improve the app's performance and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All user data is stored locally on the user's device. Since the app does not use cloud storage or syncing, user data does not leave the device. While the data is not encrypted, it remains secure within the device's storage.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share user data with third parties. Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics collect anonymous usage data, which is used exclusively for internal analysis and app improvement.</p>

    <h2>5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not specifically designed for children under 13. However, it is available to users of all ages. We ensure that no personal data is collected from any user, including children.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Users have full control over their data and can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete individual notes by swiping left on the note.</li>
        <li>Delete all notes via the "Delete All" option in the app menu.</li>
    </ul>
